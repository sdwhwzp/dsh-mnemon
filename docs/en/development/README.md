# Development and Verification

[简体中文](../../zh-CN/development/README.md) | **English** | [Documentation Center](../README.md)

## Environment and commands

The plugin's Node engine floor is 20. The pinned complete DSH development profile is the 0.1.5-rc.1 release published on npm latest and needs Node `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0`; use Node 24 for development. Root, Source Client tests and the external artifact consumer use that rc.1 cohort. `dsh-invariants` closes its peer graph, while `dsh-client-store` owns the public selector type used by the subagent projection adapter. Public Node entries are also smoke-tested on Node 20 in CI; a source-overlay helper remains available for explicitly requested investigations.

DSH 0.1.5 UI primitives import Markdown/highlighting dependencies that its published manifest lists as development dependencies. Root, the three Source packages and the external consumer declare that complete cohort explicitly for standalone Client tests; Host artifacts still use DSH’s provided UI module. Tests use the public async Agent factory and durable `assistant/message` events. `tests/legacy-session-repair.spec.ts` runs the real released Session v0 → v3 migration over a synthetic 0.1.2-produced log, in plain and compressed form, and checks copy-only recovery and cold reopen.

The reviewed rc.1 cohort is enumerated with exact versions under `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` because pnpm 11 may encounter the packages while they are inside its release-age quarantine. A composition test requires that list to equal the rc.1 packages in the lockfile and rejects a scope wildcard, so later `@deepseek-ai` publications remain quarantined.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run verify
pnpm run verify:plugins
```

`verify` checks types, deterministic Root builds, independent plugin builds, the full test suite, a real isolated DSH Headless profile and package exports/contents. Independent plugin checks run as separate type/test phases after building all public artifacts. Do not mix `pnpm -r verify` clean builds with tests reading sibling artifacts; use `pnpm verify` for the whole workspace. `verify:plugins` repeats verification **outside** the workspace against semver-installed tarballs and an external Source/Strategy/Provider/Client consumer. It also installs only the packed Root into real DSH, resolving all sixteen official plugins from a loopback registry without workspace links or manifest rewrites, then separately verifies the three shipped enhancements moving from disabled defaults to simultaneous activation. The external consumer compiles its own Strategy extension against the owning Strategy's packed SDK.

Root owns Core/SDK and the DSH Host/default Starter, not Source storage implementations. Each directory under `plugins/` is a publishable standalone project. The default distribution depends on all sixteen official plugins by public semver; the three enhancement packages are installed by the Starter but their Entries are disabled by default. Source/Strategy peers depend on Core's public SDK, Strategy extensions on their owner's public SDK, and Providers on the Memory Spaces SDK. Peer/development relationships can produce a package-manager cycle warning; production import boundaries are independently checked.

No private workspace packages, forwarding controller modules, business bindings or compatibility directory remain. Compatibility means retained user configuration, data and workflows, not retention of historical internal symbols.

Build Root before plugin clients that need its public browser artifact:

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm --workspace-concurrency=1 -r build
pnpm --filter dsh-mnemon-source-runtime verify
```

A plugin can be copied to a new repository and use its own `pnpm install && pnpm verify` once its declared peer versions are available. During unreleased development, use packed artifacts and the local-registry verification harness; do not substitute repository source paths.

## Test ownership and coverage

| Boundary | Tests |
|---|---|
| Core/SDK | Immutable Views, budgets, Strategy validation, concurrent turns, grants, leases, generation replacement, cleanup and performance |
| Strategy extension | Independent slots, combination/order, unload, conflict, read-only scope, shared quotas and actual Host activation |
| Source | Its controller/storage, revisions, snapshots, JSON operations, own Client clicks and instance isolation |
| Provider | Driver behavior, credentials, capability truth and fault responses |
| Memory Spaces | Provider child lifecycle, cross-provider conformance, merge/routing/quality and Native process serialization |
| Host | Default composition, settings/data scope, tools, supervised workflows, RPC authority, receipts and UX |
| Artifact | Every public entry, standalone install/build/test, external composition and browser artifacts |

Remote Provider suites use controlled HTTP responses; Native process suites use controlled command runners plus an optional Windows binary smoke. A separate opt-in test uses an official checksum-verified Native binary to create a disposable space, write through a View, recall and forget:

```sh
MNEMON_NATIVE_TEST_CLI=/absolute/path/to/mnemon pnpm --filter dsh-mnemon-source-memory-spaces exec vitest run tests/native-integration.spec.ts
```

The test never discovers a personal data root or installs a binary. These checks do not certify every live external service or every account configuration. Provider Lab is an explicit separate integration environment.

The opt-in Flash pressure suite uses four real DSH sessions, delegated writers, independent maintenance tasks and a disposable Native store. It keeps the default 10 KiB limit and verifies exact committed content across repeated archival, namespace routing and session-free browser management. Supply a DeepSeek credential through `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` and a verified CLI through `MNEMON_NATIVE_TEST_CLI`, then run:

```sh
MNEMON_RUN_FLASH_STRESS=1 MNEMON_FLASH_STRESS_ROUNDS=8 MNEMON_FLASH_STRESS_REPORT=/tmp/mnemon-flash-stress.json pnpm exec vitest run tests/runtime-capacity-flash-stress.spec.ts
```

Every outgoing request and returned model is checked against `deepseek-v4-flash`; the suite uses non-thinking mode and never selects Pro. It reports model input changes separately from storage changes, uses synthetic project facts, and removes its temporary stores and sessions. Destination authorization is a hard assertion; semantic topic matches are reported separately as model quality. Set `MNEMON_FLASH_STRESS_JSON_PROMPT=1` to repeat the quoted-JSON input diagnostic. It is skipped in ordinary CI and requires explicitly authorized live API usage.

The separate automatic-memory acceptance suite simulates backend, frontend, Android and operations work in four concurrent DSH sessions. Developer prompts contain accepted decisions, corrections and disposable diagnostics; the model chooses its own memory actions. Actual temporary JSON files provide bounded development tasks, while the real default lifecycle performs idle review. Fresh reader sessions have no development transcript or file access. Supply the same credential and CLI environment variables, then run:

```sh
MNEMON_RUN_FLASH_QUALITY=1 MNEMON_FLASH_QUALITY_REPORT=/tmp/mnemon-flash-quality.json pnpm exec vitest run tests/runtime-memory-flash-quality.spec.ts
MNEMON_RUN_FLASH_QUALITY=1 MNEMON_FLASH_QUALITY_WAVES=24 MNEMON_FLASH_QUALITY_REPORT=/tmp/mnemon-flash-quality-long.json pnpm exec vitest run tests/runtime-memory-flash-quality.spec.ts -t 'four preconfigured'
```

The default is 12 waves per session; the extended workload has 24. Both use Flash with thinking disabled, guided recall/writeback and the default 10,240-byte memory limit. Only the idle debounce is shortened from 30 to 5 seconds; eligibility rules stay unchanged. The suite records retained facts, transient markers, corrected answers, module attribution, no-write turns, tool errors and archival. A successful Vitest run means the experiment completed: inspect `finalEvaluation.automatedVerdict` and manually audit retained prose for stale documents, duplicates and scope errors before declaring quality acceptance. The [2026-09-09 acceptance report](../../pr-assets/runtime-memory-quality-flash-20260909/README.md) records failures as well as successful checks. Ordinary CI skips both live cases. This simulation does not substitute for full application builds, a half-day human workflow or Windows testing.

Keep generated live-run output outside the repository, as the commands above do. Follow the [evidence storage policy](../../pr-assets/README.md): commit summaries, reproduction inputs and minimal examples; attach complete sanitized run data to the PR with its revision and SHA-256.

The performance regression composes 100 three-Source Views under wall/CPU budgets. Deterministic builds compare all generated hashes. Neither check promises production network latency or LLM quality.

Both the default and three-extension profiles run that performance fence. The
[2026-09-01 Strategy contribution verification](../../pr-assets/strategy-extensions-20260901/README.md)
records coexistence, independent artifacts, real Headless activation and limits.

## Real WebUI

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm --workspace-concurrency=1 -r build
pnpm e2e:serve
```

The fixture prints a temporary workspace and loopback URL. It isolates `DSH_HOME`, `MNEMON_DATA_DIR`, browser workspace and model endpoint. Select **Mnemon E2E** for a conversation; this test-owned preset omits Shell requirements while retaining Host memory tools. The model returns a fixed answer, so this fixture checks UI and transport, not real-model distillation quality. Stop with Ctrl-C to remove its synthetic data.

`pnpm e2e:serve --review-evidence --strategy-extensions` adds a per-Agent synthetic overview tool and fixed parent/reviewer calls. It verifies five inherited chunks and attempts the same foreign read before and after the guard; see the [issue #211 evidence](../../pr-assets/issue-211-20260911/README.md). `tests/review-evidence-host.spec.ts` also covers real DSH native and Code Mode dispatch before the provider's start promise returns.

Check Sidebar without a session, all primary/secondary tabs, Runtime add/edit/remove and branch clear, Documents create/search/read, Provider settings/discovery, activation, error states, dialog cancellation, Save-to-memory, layout switching, locale and restoration of chat interaction. Use a disposable real Provider or controlled fixture for write/read/forget; never test against personal memory.

For an embedded Electron Host, pass `pnpm e2e:serve --electron=/absolute/path/to/electron` (on macOS, use `Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron`). Supply a separately installed test Electron executable and an isolated npm prefix through `MNEMON_CLI_PATH` and `npm_config_prefix`. The fixture runs the published DSH Web stack in Electron's main process with no `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` on the Host. It exposes Node internals for the published Cordis loader, without rebuilding or modifying DSH packages. Stop with Ctrl-C as usual.

Also switch `displayMode` live: Sidebar and Builtin must never mount together. Both use the same Source pages; Builtin follows its owning session for global/workspace/workspaces/custom reads, writes and tasks, hides scope controls, and clears stale data and editors when the session changes. Check legacy `buildin` normalization and the collapsed icon under the native Sidebar skin as well as supported layout plugins.

The [2026-09-04 main-rebase verification](../../pr-assets/main-rebase-20260904/README.md) records the exact v0.4.7/DSH rc.1 revisions, full registry and source-overlay suites, independent artifacts, plugin composition persistence and real shared-placement checks, including their limits.

The [2026-08-30 npm regression record](../../pr-assets/npm-sidebar-cli/README.md#english) preserves the old Taskboard/SSH and CLI investigation. Its removed legacy harness is not a current checkout command; use `pnpm e2e:serve` for current WebUI work.

The previous DSH 0.1.1-rc.2 line does not fully unload every Client module on bundle changes. Refresh after Client package/locale registration changes when exercising that rollback target; ordinary Mnemon settings still apply live. Separate upstream profile/transport warnings from Mnemon failures rather than hiding the console.

For the Documents archive regression, use `pnpm e2e:serve --document-archive`. Create and activate a disposable exact-write Memory Space, create a document and archive it from the workbench. A title containing `REJECT` deliberately proposes an invalid destination; verify that the document stays active and no index appears. Rename it and retry. Send `archive-tool-222 prepare`, `archive-tool-222 update`, and `archive-tool-222` in separate Mnemon E2E conversation turns to drive real create → update → archive tools and assert the returned lineage. Only model decisions are scripted; storage, tools, transport and the browser remain real. The same fixture can reproduce the legacy receipt-index mismatch when used with the old Host build.

## Optional DSH source overlay

Registry packages are the default and were used for the 0.1.5 checks. For a maintainer-requested investigation, `pnpm dsh:link-source` can link a separately built Harness checkout selected through `DSH_SOURCE_ROOT`; `pnpm dsh:restore-registry` restores the original links. It changes generated `node_modules` only, never the published dependency versions or tsconfig source paths. The linked checkout must supply the current package cohort; run checks appropriate to that target.

The historical 0.1.2-alpha.5 full-suite procedure belongs to its recorded revision, not this checkout: current fixtures require the 0.1.5 Session migration and message contracts. See [earlier registry/source evidence](../../pr-assets/main-rebase-20260904/README.md) and [current 0.1.5 verification](../../pr-assets/issue-223-dsh-015/README.md).

## Releasing

Official packages use independent versions; the Starter pins a tested combination. See [Release process](./releasing.md) for changesets, frozen artifacts, Registry checks and recovery.

## Documentation, storage and historical evidence

Keep English/Chinese pages aligned and public examples executable. Code-native Mermaid diagrams describe ownership and flow; real screenshots remain under `docs/assets`. Do not retain dead directory stubs or historical wrapper files.

Retain persisted formats and existing config keys unless an explicit migration is designed and tested. Verify locking, atomic rename, revisions, corrupt inputs and copied-root upgrade/rollback before changing storage.

The v0.3 release benchmark is a frozen historical result, not a test of this architecture. Its obsolete executable harness was removed from the working tree; [release notes](../releases/v0.3.0.md) link to the versioned historical source. Current gates are the scripts above.
