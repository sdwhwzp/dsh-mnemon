# Sidebar and Conversation UI Guide

[简体中文](../../zh-CN/guides/ui-guide.md) | **English** | [Documentation hub](../README.md)

The default entry is Sidebar. Optional Builtin placement embeds the same pages in a conversation. v0.5 keeps the familiar workflow and adds three Memory enhancement switches under **Settings → Memory System**, not a View page or generic plugin manager.

## See it in use

Screenshots below show the released **v0.5.4** interface in **Light** appearance, after importing a Mnemon Pack into a disposable local DSH environment. The imported data includes 20 Runtime entries, 12 Documents and four Memory Spaces, two active. Interface labels use **memory space / 记忆空间**; the original Chinese record content remains Chinese in both locales. [Capture details and limits](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/README.md).

[Watch the 42-second Light demonstration](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/en/demo.mp4): browse imported spaces, open and cancel drafts, retrieve evidence, inspect the graph, and check npm guidance and subpackage versions. The [full bilingual gallery](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/README.md) also covers settings, backup import and narrow layouts.

Older media remain available with their original version labels in [historical evidence](../../pr-assets/README.md).

## Interaction model

The Memory System sidebar entry always opens its workspace, including after visiting Task Board or SSH. Clicking it again keeps the current page open; use Back to conversation to close it.

With `displayMode: builtin`, open Memory System from the conversation's tabs instead; the Sidebar entry is absent. The header omits storage-mode and workspace-selection controls because the Host uses the owning session's global, workspace, centralized workspaces or custom scope. All Source pages and dialogs below are shared, and conversation shortcuts open the matching tab. See [scope mapping](../reference/configuration.md#entry-placement-displaymode-and-tabenabled).

Primary pages remain **Status, Runtime, Documents, Memory Spaces**. Memory Spaces adds **Overview, Recall, Content, Entities**, with **Remember** and **Distillation strategy** at the top right. A generated View is an internal per-turn runtime artifact, not a navigation page; Status does not own plugin discovery or installation.

| Visible action | What happens after the click | Independent task Agent? |
|---|---|---|
| Refresh status, synchronize now, click a Memory Space card | The Host reads asynchronously; one region spinner or the card's state dot shows progress | No |
| Toggle a Memory enhancement | Enable or disable one shipped behavior for future turns | No |
| Direct search, browse Content, inspect Entities | Provider-native read contracts run concurrently and render progressively | No |
| Agent query | Recall runs first; bounded evidence goes to a clean top-level task Agent | Yes, read-only |
| Remember / Save to memory | An editable confirmation precedes qualification, deduplication, distillation, routing, and writing | Starts after confirmation |
| AI metadata | Each space samples quickly and generates independently; one failure remains on its card | Yes, isolated per space |
| Archive | A searchable cold reference is created before the Host moves the original | Starts after confirmation |

## 1. Status: establish readiness

![Current status and Native readiness](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/en/status.jpg)

The top Memory Engine area shows only dsh-mnemon. Mnemon Native has its own status bar; its failure does not become a global banner. External Providers appear below with enabled, health, and connection state.

The page loads concurrently and progressively. Only one region-level spinner remains while work is pending; returned data appears immediately. Status also summarizes Runtime, Documents, Memory Spaces, storage root, and dsh-mnemon / Mnemon versions.

### Check versions

![npm guidance for the detected CLI installation](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/en/versions.jpg)

Checking is read-only. Mnemon CLI distinguishes missing, unreadable, current, and update-available installations, with npm install, migration, or update commands that can be copied. Registry failures leave local installation guidance visible. Commands run on the DSH Host; verify the executable path after installing or changing PATH.

Expand **Subpackage versions** under dsh-mnemon to inspect Sources, Strategies, and Providers. Each row shows installed and published versions, the Starter pin where applicable, and its maintenance method. Starter dependencies update with the Starter's tested combination; packages installed independently in the current Profile can update individually. Source links show local build instructions. Page updates require management access and `writeEnabled`; version checks and command copying remain available in read-only mode. Restart `dsh web` after package updates; the restart reminder remains on subsequent checks.

## Memory enhancements: expose stable behavior only

![Default memory layers and three optional enhancements](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/en/enhancements.jpg)

There is no standalone View page, and Status exposes no plugin catalog, dependency graph, or installation flow. The Starter ships three disabled enhancements using the same switches as other settings under **Settings → Memory System → Memory enhancements**:

- **Active capture** identifies and records facts worth retaining from the current conversation;
- **Light context** reduces resident content while preserving on-demand reads;
- **Scoped composition** combines the currently available memory sources in stable order.

A switch applies immediately to future turns; it never rewrites a turn that already pinned its View. All three may be enabled together, and disabling one never deletes Source data. The UI describes observable behavior only—never package names, Entries, dependencies, or conflicts. Third-party Sources and Strategies continue to use DSH Profile/Loader installation and composition; see [Building Memory Plugins](../development/extensions.md) for the author contract and contribution path.

## 2. Runtime: maintain every-turn context

![Runtime totals and two imported User Profile entries](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/en/runtime.jpg)

The header summarizes User Profile (`USER.md`) and Working Memory (`MEMORY.md`). A shared card style lists items below. Filter by source, text, category, and importance; clicking the current filter again never breaks the page. Long fields truncate within their own block and reveal the complete value on hover.

Runtime entries display their creation time, newest first, across both targets and text filters. Editing an older entry keeps its original position. Show more continues in the same order.

When Working Memory reaches capacity, the Host archives the exact original entries. If a routing batch fails or returns an invalid proposal, that entire batch uses the eligible default Memory Space (or the first eligible space when no default is available). Earlier valid batches keep their destinations, and the maintenance summary records the fallback reason. Caller cancellation still stops the operation.

Runtime items should be compact, independent, and repeatedly useful. Working Memory items can carry an optional branch scope (comma-separated git branch names in the add and edit forms): scoped items show a branch badge and are projected into the model context only while the session workspace is checked out on a listed branch; leaving the field empty keeps an item visible on every branch. The scope never affects this page or the on-disk `USER.md`/`MEMORY.md` projections. Identity, preferences, and explicit collaboration rules belong in User Profile. Project facts, environment, decisions, and tool lessons belong in Working Memory. Temporary progress and raw logs do not.

## 3. Documents: preserve complete project narratives

![Imported project document directory and Markdown reader](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/en/documents.jpg)

Select a DSH workspace first: Documents needs a workspace identity even with global/custom storage. A selected conversation supplies its workspace; Workspace storage also allows explicit inspection selection. This identifies the project without changing the selected storage root.

Switch between active and archived directories. Repeatedly clicking the selected entry keeps it selected; it never closes the reader. The right pane preserves title, retrieval description, provenance, revision, hash, size, and full Markdown, and resets to the top when selection changes.

Active and archived lists, including search matches, display creation dates and sort newest first before loading more documents. Updating an older document does not move it to the top.

For explicit archive or foreground capacity maintenance, an independent task Agent proposes a summary and one existing eligible Memory Space. It has no memory tools. The Host validates the proposal, adds the exact cold path and content hash, stores the index and builds lineage from its own receipt before moving the original. The destination must be active and support exact writes and safe forget; configure a suitable space before archiving.

An invalid proposal leaves both the active document and Memory Spaces unchanged. If moving the document fails, the Host attempts to remove only the newly created index. Existing verified indexes are reused and never deleted by this cleanup. If cleanup fails or the Provider outcome is uncertain, inspect the reported destination and index before retrying; this is compensating cleanup, not a cross-Provider database transaction.

Background review preserves existing document bodies. It searches first, skips covered candidates, and creates a separate supplementary document only for substantial new knowledge. It cannot update or archive existing documents; if capacity is exhausted, it skips creation. Normal explicit edits remain available.

Review reuses complete overviews, file excerpts, rules, and tool results already inherited from the completed conversation. It cannot reopen files or call another plugin's overview tools. Missing evidence permits a bounded Document search; if that is insufficient, review skips the candidate.

Title and retrieval description determine discoverability, source path preserves provenance, and the body keeps Markdown structure. Source project files remain read-only; the workbench creates a managed copy.

## 4. Memory Spaces: one replaceable third tier

### Overview and live snapshot

![Four imported Memory Spaces with two active](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/en/spaces.jpg)

Read the live snapshot in two layers from top to bottom:

- Each **Snapshot visibility** card represents one active Memory Space and declares the read surface, projection mode, and observable count its Provider can actually supply. `Real graph`, `Content projection`, and `Query only` are capability boundaries, not quality levels.
- The **Live multi-memory snapshot** merges those readable results into one relationship graph. Edge colors distinguish space ownership, temporal, semantic, causal, and entity-association links, while Provider and Memory Space labels preserve provenance.
- The lower left reports total spaces, memories, and entities; the lower right reports currently rendered elements and connections. A value such as `60 / 129` is an interactive rendering window, not missing data.
- Select a Memory Space, entity, or memory node to inspect its exact context on the right. Natural layout, dragging, and even reset change presentation only; they never rewrite Provider data.

![Live graph from the two active native spaces](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/en/graph.jpg)

Each card represents a real space. Provider tags use color without duplicating icons inside tags; `Mnemon Native` appears as `mnemon` in the catalog. Click a card to reconnect only that Provider + ID. During reconnect, its state dot becomes an equal-size spinner; no global synchronization runs.

The first Overview visit performs one full synchronization. Later refreshes are on demand. **Synchronize now** remains at the top right beside elapsed time since the last full sync.

Snapshot visibility declares the read surface each space can actually honor before rendering the combined graph:

- Mnemon Native supplies full typed relationships;
- Hindsight and Holographic contribute their real graphs;
- providers without edges contribute content projections only;
- query-only providers such as ByteRover wait for an explicit query.

The UI never fabricates unsupported relationships, entities, deletion, or browse capability.

### Create a Memory Space manually

![Create a named memory space with a Provider](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/en/space-create.jpg)

Clicking Create always asks the user to choose a Provider explicitly. Only services enabled in Settings appear. Provider-specific fields use a vertical layout to avoid alignment drift. The new instance enters catalog, activation, and recall only after creation.

### Distillation strategy: manual or smart

Distillation strategy routes later Agent writes; it does not change manual creation:

- **Manual** uses an explicitly constrained target;
- **Smart selection** treats data boundary and required capabilities as hard rules, then uses local/shared preference and a prompt as soft policy. A model runs only when several candidates remain eligible.

The receipt keeps decision source, confidence, and reason. Provider credentials never enter model context.

### AI metadata

Select several active spaces. Each task uses that Provider's fastest native query to fetch a small sample, then follows system-prompt length and capability constraints for title and description. Tasks share no state; a failure appears only on its card. If a model-generated title or description fails the local length check, that card keeps its previous metadata while valid results still update. The dialog stays open and each card plays a rightward same-tone refresh animation before updating in place.

Generated title and description are local catalog metadata and survive ordinary reconnects. Disabling a Provider clears mapping and metadata. Re-enabling rebuilds them from Provider data, using the closest default only for unmapped fields.

### Remember

Normally, provide only a candidate. Confirmation starts a clean task Agent to qualify, choose the narrowest space, deduplicate, distill, and write. Manual advanced options are for genuinely required target, category, or importance constraints.

### Recall and Agent Query

![Keyword recall of an imported record](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/en/recall.jpg)

- **Direct search** returns raw evidence without an Agent.
- **Agent query** uses the same evidence, then starts an evidence-only top-level task Agent.
- Providers return concurrently; one connection failure never hides other sources.
- Rank fusion orders providers while retaining engine-native score, ID, space, Provider, and category.
- Related, Link, Browse, and Forget appear only when genuinely supported.

Focused questions are usually more reliable than broad keywords.

### Content and Entities

![Native evidence with provenance](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/en/content.jpg)

Content distinguishes enumerable, query-only, and unavailable surfaces. A Provider tag both applies a filter and clears it when clicked again. Entities aggregates only real indexes—currently Mnemon Native, Hindsight, and Holographic—rather than inferring capability from ordinary text.

The [entity view](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/en/entities.jpg) shows the same imported evidence connected through its native APPSO entity index.

### Narrow layouts

The 390 × 844 captures cover [directory navigation](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/en/spaces-mobile.jpg), [long-name cards](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/en/space-directory-mobile.jpg), the [creation sheet](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/en/space-create-mobile.jpg) and [version maintenance](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/en/versions-mobile.jpg). Long card names and some metrics truncate at this width. These browser captures do not establish complete phone or Host-settings compatibility; see [known limits](../reference/compatibility.md).

## 5. Settings: services are not Memory Space instances

Settings centralizes stable user choices and reusable **service configuration**:

- Memory Source cards come from the live Catalog. Runtime, Documents, and Memory Spaces each have one master switch, with no additional participation-mode controls;
- Memory enhancements provide three shipped switches—Active capture, Light context, and Scoped composition—disabled by default and applied immediately to future turns;
- every external Provider has its own switch and is off by default;
- endpoint, API Key, and Provider-specific fields appear only after enabling;
- API Keys use a conventional password field whose eye button toggles visible/hidden; there is no clear-credential checkbox, dedicated Remove row, or saved-secret caption;
- the three enhancement switches apply immediately; the footer Save action persists all other changes without waiting for discovery or recall. Health belongs on Status and instances belong on Overview;
- global / workspace / custom tags show effective scope; Providers with the same scope semantics reuse Mnemon's configuration framework.
- Choose **Settings → Memory System → Memory scope → Centralized · isolated by workspace** to collect project-isolated memory in one directory. Its optional **Central root directory** field is in the same section; leave it empty for `MNEMON_DATA_DIR` or `~/.mnemon`. The independent **Global user profile** option remains available.

- User profile scope is independent: **Global user profile** combines global USER.md with workspace/custom MEMORY.md without moving either source.

Each default layer has one master switch. “On” permits on-demand use; it does not force Recall on every turn.

Mnemon-specific custom directory, backup, and migration remain in Mnemon's own expandable area. Custom is an explicit-path global scope.

### Mnemon Native embedding bridge

**Manage embedding settings in DSH** makes the saved endpoint, model, protocol and optional API key authoritative for Mnemon child processes, including Desktop launches that do not inherit shell startup files. Automatic protocol selection treats an endpoint ending in `/v1` as OpenAI-compatible; other compatible endpoints require explicit protocol selection. The URL rejects embedded credentials, queries and fragments. Memory and query text are sent to the configured service. **Test status** checks saved values, not an unsaved draft. See [embedding configuration and safety](../reference/configuration.md) before enabling it.

Disabling a Source does not delete data. Its Sidebar tab remains visible with an Off badge and opens a reversible disabled-state explanation without reading the data plane; re-enabling restores the existing data. A newly contributed extension Source starts disabled. The current runtime generation keeps serving until the candidate validates and swaps, so a rejected candidate never leaves a partial configuration active.

### Background task Agent model route

**Follow main route** uses DSH's default for a new session. **Choose model provider** stores a complete Provider + Model route. It affects AI metadata, Agent Query, Remember, smart Provider selection, and Document archive only; it never changes the current main conversation model. Reasoning strength depends on both selected Provider capability and DSH route support.

The picker displays the capabilities reported by DSH. An **Image input** label describes the selected model's capability; current Mnemon background jobs still send text-only prompts.

Switches, radio options, and eye buttons tolerate repeated clicks—including clicking the already-selected value—without unmounting or blanking the page.

## 6. In-conversation interaction

### Turn memory

Turn memory appears only on completed turns with memory activity. Expand or collapse it repeatedly. Clicking an exact tool opens its matching Recall, Content, Entities, or Documents page.

### Save to memory

Save to memory sits in the native action strip for finalized replies. The first click only reads that reply and opens an editable dialog. Cancel has no data effect. Only **Confirm and send to independent task Agent** starts distillation.

Both conversation controls are on by default and can be changed independently under **Settings → Memory System → Conversation interface**. Saving applies live.

## Workspace mode: inspection and execution are distinct

| Concept | Selected by | Affects |
|---|---|---|
| **Inspected workspace** | Workbench header selector | Which `<workspace>/.mnemon` the UI displays and maintains manually |
| **Effective workspace** | Current conversation / Agent cwd | Which root conversation tools, commands, and lifecycle hooks use |

You may inspect project B while staying in project A's conversation. The conversation Agent remains on A; AI metadata, Agent Query, Remember, and Document archive launched from the workbench create clean task Agents explicitly scoped to B. This works even when no main session is selected.

Remote Provider workspaces, users, banks, projects, containers, and URIs are independent namespaces and never change implicitly with the DSH workspace. `global` and `custom` resolve to one explicit root and need no inspection/execution alignment.

## Common rules

- Solid blue means primary action; blue outline usually means Edit; red is reserved for Delete, Disconnect, Archive, or Forget; neutral actions are View, Copy, and Cancel.
- A Memory Space toggle controls only whether dsh-mnemon includes it in read routing. It is not the Mnemon CLI default Store.
- Mnemon Native physical deletion requires confirmation. External spaces use Disconnect and leave Provider data untouched.
- Pages load by region; a local error never blocks unrelated data or creates a wall of spinners.
- The workbench defaults to Sidebar; Builtin puts the same UI in the owning conversation. Turn memory and Save to memory remain conversation shortcuts.
