# Getting started

[简体中文](../../zh-CN/guides/getting-started.md) | **English** | [Documentation hub](../README.md)

This guide starts from a DSH with dsh-mnemon installed and ends with memory that a conversation actually uses. It keeps the defaults: the Memory System in the sidebar, global storage and the Layered strategy. You do not need to know about Views or Strategies for everyday use.

First time? Start with [Install and start](./installation.md): from installing Node.js to installing and enabling dsh-mnemon on the Plugins page and your first memory, with a screenshot for every step. Already installed? Jump to [Open the Memory System](#2-open-the-memory-system). Upgrading? Follow [compatibility and upgrades](../reference/compatibility.md).

## 1. Install and upgrade from the command line

This section is for command-line users and also covers development checkouts, cloud access and Headless. You need:

- DSH `0.2.0-rc.2` (npm `latest` and `next`) or `0.1.7-rc.2`, Node.js `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0`, and pnpm;
- a DSH model route that can create independent task Agents;
- for Mnemon Native only, a local `mnemon` CLI; [Install and start](./installation.md#other-ways-to-install-the-mnemon-cli) covers each platform. The other Providers connect to their own services.

Install and check DSH:

```sh
npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh
dsh --version
npm view @deepseek-ai/dsh dist-tags
```

The Starter pins a tested combination of the official plugins; the [compatibility matrix](../reference/compatibility.md) lists it. Mnemon's Node 20 entry checks do not establish full Host compatibility.

<details>
<summary>How task Agents are started</summary>

Semantic work prefers a DSH provider named `spawn` with `toolFilter`, `persona` and `depthLimit`. Mnemon keeps one stable `mnemon_subagent_result` tool and issues a revocable `requestId` for each child. The child returns `{ requestId, result }`; the Host validates `result` against that operation's schema and rejects stale or foreign submissions. Optional background review defaults to a guarded `spawn` child with a bounded checkpoint; a full-context `fork` is opt-in. See [review compatibility and limits](../reference/configuration.md#provider-requirements).

</details>

Install into the Web profile for the complete workbench:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-mnemon
```

Use an absolute path for a development checkout:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add "link:/absolute/path/to/dsh-mnemon"
```

Then start or restart the profile:

```sh
dsh --profile web
```

If the Web profile is reached through a cloud hostname, do not publish port 3080 directly. DSH authenticates every Mnemon RPC and stream through a browser session established from the one-time URL printed at Host startup. Configure the HTTPS reverse proxy or access gateway and trusted authority together, then open that launch URL, by following [Cloud-hosted WebUI](./operations.md#cloud-hosted-webui).

Upgrade and uninstall:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web update dsh-mnemon
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-mnemon
```

Restart DSH after an update. For 24 hours after a release, pnpm 11 keeps `update` on the installed version; add the new version by name instead (`dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-mnemon@<version>`). Uninstall removes the plugin registration, not memory data in global, workspace, or custom roots.

Profiles have independent plugin rosters. Install the package separately into Headless when one-shot tasks also need memory:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile headless add dsh-mnemon
dsh --profile headless "Check durable project context before answering this task."
```

For a development checkout, replace the package name with `"link:/absolute/path/to/dsh-mnemon"`. Headless mounts the same Runtime context, Documents, Memory Space tools, lifecycle guidance, and supervised write path as a Web Agent. It does not mount the workbench, conversation buttons, RPC channels, or an interactive slash-command surface.

With `storageScope=workspace`, Headless resolves `<invocation cwd>/.mnemon`; no Web workspace registry is required. The one-shot runner exits when its Agent becomes idle, so shutdown cancels any delayed score-based background review that has not started. Explicit or model-guided writes that finish during the task are durable.

## 2. Open the Memory System

Click **Memory System** in the sidebar. It opens on **Status**.

![Status with each memory component and the Providers](../../assets/webui-v0.5.19/en/memory-status.jpg)

Check that:

- the header says **Connected** and names the main strategy, *Layered strategy* by default;
- the engine card shows the dsh-mnemon version, and the Mnemon CLI appears under **Memory providers** if you installed it;
- Runtime memory, Project Documents and Memory Spaces each have a card without errors;
- the storage root matches your storage scope.

Project Documents needs a DSH workspace even with global storage. Select a workspace for the conversation; "Waiting for workspace" means the project context is missing, not the CLI. If the Mnemon CLI is missing, run `command -v mnemon` and `mnemon --version` on macOS or Linux, or `Get-Command mnemon` on Windows. See [troubleshooting](./operations.md#troubleshooting) for other symptoms.

## 3. Store your first memories

**Runtime memory.** Open **Runtime memory**, choose **Add memory** and save a preference in the user profile or a project fact in working memory. It is injected into every later turn.

**A document.** Open **Project Documents**, choose **New document** and save a short design note or checklist. The Agent searches documents when a question needs them.

**A memory space.** Open **Memory Spaces → Overview** and choose **Create Memory Space**:

1. Pick a Provider. Mnemon Native, the local default, is offered once its CLI is installed; enable third-party Providers on [Memory Spaces' page](./ui-guide.md#on-the-plugins-page) first.
2. Give it a narrow name, such as *Project decisions*, and describe what belongs there.
3. Keep it active so conversations can read it.

In an empty storage root, the first Mnemon Native space uses Mnemon's `default` store id while keeping your name and description; spaces on other Providers get their own ids. Then choose **Save to memory**, enter something stable and secret-free, and choose **Send to task Agent**. An independent task Agent picks the space, removes duplicates and writes, and its receipt says where it went.

**Check it.** Open **Memory Spaces → Recall**, ask a concrete question and choose **Direct search**. Each result keeps its memory space, category, importance and score; copy its id when you need it.

![Direct search across the active memory spaces](../../assets/webui-v0.5.19/en/memory-recall.jpg)

You can also use conversation commands:

```text
/mnemon status
/mnemon recall <focused query>
```

## 4. Use memory in a conversation

Ask a question that depends on what you stored, and let the Agent decide whether it needs memory. After the reply:

- a **Turn memory** line appears if the turn used memory; expand it to see the documents and memories each tool read or wrote, and select one to open it where it lives;
- the brain mark under the reply is **Save to memory**: it opens an editable dialog, **Cancel** writes nothing, and sending it to the task Agent returns a receipt.

![An answer that uses working memory, Project Documents and Memory Spaces, with the items the turn read](../../assets/webui-v0.5.19/en/chat-recall.jpg)

Ordinary conversation does not force recall. Current requests, repository files and live tool results outrank remembered history.

## 5. Choose how memory is composed

Open **Plugins → dsh-mnemon**, or the gear in the Memory System header.

![The Memory composition board](../../assets/webui-v0.5.19/en/plugin-composition.jpg)

- **Main strategy**: keep the **Layered strategy**, or choose the **General strategy** to offer every available source in one budget and let the model decide.
- **Memory sources**: Runtime memory, Project Documents and Memory Spaces, one switch each. Turning one off stops its context, tools and background work without deleting data.
- **Enhancements**: Active capture, Light context and Scoped composition are off by default; each works with either main strategy.
- **Storage**: Global (default) shares one directory; Workspace keeps each workspace's own `.mnemon`; Centralized keeps each workspace under one root. **Data directory** is Default or Custom. Changing either never moves existing data.
- **Interface**: open the Memory System in the sidebar or as a conversation tab, and turn the conversation controls on or off.

Switches and selectors apply at once; storage changes wait for **Apply**. The [UI guide](./ui-guide.md#on-the-plugins-page) covers every page, and [Configuration](../reference/configuration.md) lists the settings behind them.

## 6. Next steps

- Learn every page in the [UI guide](./ui-guide.md).
- Decide what belongs in runtime memory, documents or memory spaces with the [storage model](../reference/storage-model.md).
- Export your first ZIP backup and prepare for upgrades with the [operations guide](./operations.md).
- Connect a long-term backend with the [Provider guide](./memory-providers.md).
