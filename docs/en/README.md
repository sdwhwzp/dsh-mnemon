# Documentation

**English** | [简体中文](../zh-CN/README.md) | [Project home](../../README.md)

dsh-mnemon gives DeepSeek Harness three kinds of memory: **runtime memory** in every turn, **Project Documents** searched when a question needs them, and **Memory Spaces** for durable evidence on the Provider you choose. A main strategy decides how they take part in each turn; you pick it, and any enhancements, on the Plugins page. Start with the default Layered strategy; you never need to manage plugins to use it.

## What is new

[v0.5.20](./releases/v0.5.20.md) folds the Starter's readiness into its component group, so no separate switch can keep the Memory System from starting, and documents recovery after updates. [v0.5.19](./releases/v0.5.19.md) added DSH 0.2.0-rc.1 support, memory management in the DSH desktop app and a guide from an empty machine to the first memory. [All releases](./releases/README.md) · [Roadmap](./roadmap.md) · [Historical evidence](../pr-assets/README.md)

Guides describe the current release. Screenshots and recordings come from the [v0.5.19 gallery](../assets/webui-v0.5.19/README.md), and the installation steps from the [installation gallery](../assets/install-v0.5.19/README.md); dated PR records establish only their named revisions and environments. Internal Host RPCs are not an external plugin SDK.
