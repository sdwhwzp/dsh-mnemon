# Documentation

**English** | [简体中文](../zh-CN/README.md) | [Project home](../../README.md)

Start with the default three-tier workflow. The implementation is composable; you do not need to manage plugins to use it.

## Use the system

| Task | Guide |
|---|---|
| Install and verify the first memory | [Getting started](./guides/getting-started.md) |
| Understand the available behaviors | [Capability map](./guides/capabilities.md) |
| Navigate Sidebar, Documents and settings | [UI guide](./guides/ui-guide.md) |
| Choose a long-term backend | [Providers](./guides/memory-providers.md) |
| Back up, restore or troubleshoot | [Operations](./guides/operations.md) |
| Upgrade an existing installation | [Compatibility and upgrades](./reference/compatibility.md) |

## Look up a contract

| Question | Reference |
|---|---|
| Which settings and scopes apply? | [Configuration](./reference/configuration.md) |
| What is stored, shared or archived? | [Storage model](./reference/storage-model.md) |
| When do reads, writes and maintenance run? | [Workflows](./reference/workflows.md) |
| Which tools and commands are exposed? | [Interfaces](./reference/interfaces.md) |

## Build an extension

| Task | Developer guide |
|---|---|
| Understand Source, Strategy, View and ownership | [Architecture](./development/architecture.md) |
| Create a Source, Strategy or Provider | [Plugin development](./development/extensions.md) |
| Adapt a skin to Mnemon backgrounds and transparency | [Skin development](./development/skin-integration.md) |
| Build, test and capture a real WebUI | [Development and verification](./development/README.md) |
| Version and release independent packages | [Release process](./development/releasing.md) |

Source owns memory and its operations; Strategy composes selected Sources; Core validates one immutable View for the executing turn. The default three tiers are one composition, not mandatory Core types. A Memory Spaces Provider is a child module of that Source.

Current guides describe the current implementation. Dated screenshots, old benchmarks and PR reports establish only their named revisions and environments. Internal Host RPCs are not an external plugin SDK.
