# Storage and the Three-Layer Memory Model

[简体中文](../../zh-CN/reference/storage-model.md) | **English** | [Documentation Center](../README.md)

## Why Three Layers

The default Starter combines three independent Sources for different access patterns. This is a useful default, not a Core requirement or a restriction on third-party Sources:

| Question | Corresponding layer | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| What must be known directly on the next turn? | Runtime Memory | Tiny and injected directly into the prompt |
| Which design or procedure needs to be read quickly and in full? | active Documents | Preserves Markdown structure without deep recall |
| Which historical facts and relationships should persist across sessions? | Memory Spaces | Independent databases, graph relationships, and on-demand recall |
| What happens when a long document is rarely used but must remain traceable? | archived Documents | Mnemon retains an index while the cold layer retains the original text |

Recommended query gradient:

```text
current request and repository facts
             |
             v
Runtime Memory already in prompt
             |
             v
search active Documents
             |
             v
recall active Memory Spaces
             |
             v
follow an exact cold reference when full text is required
```

## Cross-agent sharing boundary

Sharing does not broadcast conversations or files. Mnemon-enabled agents can share durable Native facts when each integrates Mnemon and can access the same storage root and recognized Stores. Third-party Providers share through their own workspace, user, bank, project or container scope. Runtime and Documents do not automatically enter other agents' context.

Use `global` for a common local root, `custom` for an explicitly agreed root, or `workspace` to constrain sharing to a project. Concurrent processes rely on the Provider's own consistency guarantees; stop all users before offline copying or directly modifying local databases. See [Operations](../guides/operations.md#backup-and-recovery).

## Unified Root Directory

```text
<storageRoot>/
+-- runtime/
|   +-- memories.json
|   +-- USER.md
|   +-- MEMORY.md
+-- documents/
|   +-- index.json
|   +-- active/
|   +-- archived/
+-- data/
|   +-- .dsh-memory-bodies.json
|   +-- <memory-space-id>/
|       +-- mnemon.db
+-- state/
    +-- memory-providers.json     # third-party connection control plane; 0600; excluded from Mnemon Packs
```

`storageScope` determines the entire root, not just the Mnemon databases. The `workspace` scope resolves an independent `<workspace>/.mnemon` for every registered DSH workspace. The opt-in `runtimeUserScope=global` is the sole split-root exception: Runtime reads USER.md from the global root while MEMORY.md and every other component remain under the selected root. Workbench tasks use the inspected workspace; conversation tools and lifecycle hooks use their owning session's cwd and pinned View. `state/memory-providers.json` stores third-party endpoints, target URIs, identities, and optional credentials. Its mode is `0600`; the Host returns configured field names, never saved credential values.

The `workspaces` layout keeps all four areas under `<central-root>/workspaces/<workspace-path-hash>/`; Host path resolution never creates files or changes old roots. Only explicit `runtimeUserScope: global` places USER.md outside that workspace subtree.


## Runtime Memory

### Semantics

- `target=user`: identity, role, long-term preferences, habits, communication style, and explicit collaboration requirements.
- `target=memory`: projects, environment, decisions, conventions, tool characteristics, and reusable experience.
- `importance=critical|normal|low`: retention priority during maintenance.
- `branches` (optional, `target=memory` only): a list of git branch names limiting where the entry is projected in the per-turn Runtime snapshot; entries without a branch list are visible on every branch.

There is currently no `daily` target.

### Source of Truth and Projections

Within one root, `runtime/memories.json` is the sole source of truth. With `runtimeUserScope=global`, the effective snapshot combines only `target=user` entries from the global source with only `target=memory` entries from the selected source. Both JSON files and both Markdown projection pairs remain complete and unchanged; filtering occurs only in the effective Runtime controller. Each record contains:

```text
content
created_at
updated_at
target
importance
branches (optional)
```

`branches` holds an optional list of git branch names for `target=memory` entries. An entry without `branches` (or with an empty list) is visible on every branch. When a session's workspace is a git working tree on branch `B`, the per-turn Runtime snapshot hides `memory` entries whose `branches` list does not include `B`; in non-git workspaces and at detached HEAD, every entry is projected. `USER.md` entries never carry `branches`.

`USER.md` and `MEMORY.md` are deterministic derived files of the complete store. Each item is normalized to one line, and items are separated by a line containing only `§`; `§` is a reserved character. During startup and prompt assembly, the control layer repairs missing or manually modified projections from the JSON source. Branch filtering applies only to the prompt projection, never to these files.

### Operations

- `add` writes an independent new fact; exactly identical content is not added twice.
- `replace` and `remove` first match the normalized full content of `old_text` within the requested `target`, then replace or remove that entire item. One exact match takes precedence even when other items contain the same text.
- When no full-content match exists, a unique substring still locates the item.
- Zero matches, duplicate exact matches, and ambiguous substring matches are rejected without changing the store; no fuzzy mutation is performed. Branch tags control projection and are not mutation selectors.

### Capacity

| Target | Limit | Maintenance method |
|---|---:|---|
| `USER.md` | 4 KiB | A local no-tool worker merges conservatively; content never enters a Memory Space |
| `MEMORY.md` | 10 KiB | The Host archives exact committed entries, then deterministically packs the hot remainder |

With the default three-tier Strategy, capacity maintenance starts when an authorized write would exceed the limit. Named tools, generic Actions, background child Agents and browser management share the same Host workflow. Browser writes use the selected storage scope without requiring an open user conversation. Archive failures preserve hot memory and return an error. Standalone Sources retain their own storage semantics; custom Strategies do not implicitly inherit default archival.

Capacity is measured from the actual UTF-8 bytes of the projection body. A single item is limited to 8 KiB. On an overflowing `add`, `replace`, or `remove`, the Host rechecks the source revision before any Provider write. With one eligible writable Memory Space it routes without a model; with several spaces, workers see only bounded routing excerpts and return destination ids, never rewritten memory. Mnemon Native reuses exact content from a readonly namespace snapshot, groups identical pending entries, and imports the remaining originals once per destination through a schema-v1 draft with `--no-diff`. Similar but distinct facts cannot be skipped or semantically replace each other during archival. Other Providers use their adapter write semantics. The Host requires one exact terminal receipt per source (and exact Recall evidence for a skipped duplicate), then selects the retained entries by importance within a byte budget and commits that remainder together with the pending mutation under the original revision fence. A Provider cannot share the local filesystem transaction, so a later revision conflict or concurrent external write may leave already archived duplicates; existing hot facts remain protected by the revision fence.

## Project Documents

### Purpose

Documents preserve project knowledge that is more complete than a single memory item but should still be quick to read, such as:

- architecture designs and rationale;
- evidence-backed investigation findings;
- operating procedures, release checklists, and incident reviews;
- implementation handoffs and long-term maintenance notes.

User profiles, ordinary conversation, temporary progress, raw large logs, and secrets should not be stored in Documents.

### Control Plane

`documents/index.json` is the metadata source of truth. It manages IDs, titles, descriptions, status, filenames, source paths, sessions, timestamps, revisions, SHA-256 values, sizes, and Memory Space references. Managed Markdown copies include generated frontmatter.

`sourcePaths`:

- may point only inside the current session workspace;
- are source references only and are never modified by the plugin;
- are not required to exist by the current implementation;
- may not point into the managed `documents/` directory itself.

### Scope

The physical sharing scope of Documents is determined by `storageScope`:

- `workspace` / `workspaces`: normally isolated with the project;
- `global` / `custom`: multiple workspaces may share the same `documents/index.json`.

Therefore, “Project Documents” describes the content type and does not guarantee physical isolation by workspace. The current session workspace constrains only `sourcePaths` on new writes.

### Capacity and Hot/Cold Tiering

| Item | Limit |
|---|---:|
| One body | 2 MiB maximum |
| Total active content | 10 MiB maximum, including generated frontmatter |
| Total archived content | Does not count toward the active limit |

The actual rendered size is calculated before creation or update. If capacity is insufficient, the least recently accessed active Document is selected by `lastAccessedAt` and then `updatedAt`; a Mnemon cold reference is written and verified first, and the original text is moved only if its revision remains unchanged.

Default search covers only active Documents. Search updates `lastAccessedAt` for matching Documents, so it is read-only with respect to bodies but writes index metadata.

## Memory Spaces

A Memory Space is the third tier's uniform semantic and routing unit; its provider chooses the data plane:

```text
id            generated by the Host or inherited from a discovered Mnemon Store
name          human-readable name
description   routing boundary: what belongs here and when to recall it
active        whether it participates in DSH reads and routing
provider      mnemon-native or one of the registered third-party engines
location      local store/CLI scope, or remote endpoint + provider scope
```

### Read and Write Boundaries

- After initialization, Mnemon's native layer retains at least one Store and selects one default through `<storageRoot>/active`; ordinary Mnemon agents continue to use this single-Store model.
- dsh-mnemon activation is an independent control plane: any 0..N Memory Spaces may be active, and making all inactive changes neither Mnemon's default Store nor remote data.
- Recall and browse use active spaces only; graph, entity, related, link, and delete behavior follows provider capabilities.
- Reads explicitly targeting an inactive Memory Space are rejected.
- Writes may target any registered space with `remember`; the receipt reflects the provider's exact or asynchronous extraction semantics.
- After a successful write to an inactive target, the plugin activates it automatically.
- Without an explicit target, if the number of active Memory Spaces is not exactly one, the deterministic service requires the caller to choose a target first.

### Creation, Discovery, and Merge

- An uninitialized root may remain at zero Stores. The first explicit Memory Space creation uses Mnemon's native `default` ID while retaining the user-supplied name and routing description; later creations use Host-generated UUIDs.
- The last native Store cannot be deleted after initialization, but its Memory Space may remain inactive. Before deleting Mnemon's default Store, the plugin switches to another existing Store.
- An existing `<storageRoot>/data/<store>/mnemon.db` is discovered and registered without moving the database.
- Merge imports source content into the target through Mnemon; the source database remains in place, and by default only the source is marked inactive.
- Pack replacement cannot empty an initialized Store set. If replacement removes the former default Store, the plugin repairs the native default pointer to an existing Store.
- `forget` is a soft delete by exact ID, not deletion of a database file.
- Users create Mnemon Native spaces directly. Enabling or saving a third-party service discovers all visible provider-native namespaces, atomically maps their titles/descriptions and scope into the directory, and makes them available as smart-selection candidates. Disabling the provider removes those local mappings and never provider content.
- Smart placement treats the allowlist, data boundary, and required capabilities as Host-enforced rules. Soft preference and prompt guide semantic choice only among multiple eligible candidates and cannot override hard rules. The decision receipt is persisted with Memory Space metadata.
- Merge remains Mnemon Native-specific. Graph, relationships, browsing, exact/async writes, and hard/soft/unsupported deletion follow each provider's declared capabilities; the UI and agents do not pretend missing behavior exists. See the [provider matrix](../guides/memory-providers.md).

### Cross-Agent Visibility

`mnemon.db` is Mnemon's native data plane, not a private dsh-mnemon format. Another Mnemon-enabled agent can access the same durable memory when it uses the same `storageRoot` and Store. dsh-mnemon also discovers compatible Stores already present on disk; DSH-specific names, descriptions, and activation state remain managed by `.dsh-memory-bodies.json`.

Third-party visibility is determined by its provider scope, such as service plus URI, workspace/peers, bank, project/user, knowledge directory, or container. No provider extends sharing to `runtime/` or `documents/`; “shared third-tier memory” must not be presented as automatic sharing of the complete DSH context.

## Four Relationship Types

Mnemon Native preserves `temporal`, `semantic`, `causal`, and `entity` relationships. Hindsight projects its provider graph, and Holographic derives local entity/semantic relationships. Providers without graph edges contribute bounded disconnected nodes; adapters never invent unsupported relationships. The UI hides Related, Link, Browse, and Forget where the selected provider does not support them.

## Data Authority Table

| Data | Authoritative source | Derived/cache |
|---|---|---|
| Hot memory | `runtime/memories.json` | `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md` |
| Documents | `documents/index.json` + managed Markdown | excerpts, search ranking, status aggregation |
| Mnemon Native catalog | `data/.dsh-memory-bodies.json` + on-disk Stores | Web status aggregation |
| Third-party connections | `state/memory-providers.json` | redacted provider capabilities and status |
| Long-term memory | Mnemon `mnemon.db` or remote provider | graph projection and cross-provider rank fusion |
| Review watermark | Host process memory | status-page snapshot; not yet persisted |
