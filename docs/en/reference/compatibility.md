# Compatibility and upgrades

**English** | [简体中文](../../zh-CN/reference/compatibility.md) | [Documentation](../README.md)

The Starter pins a tested combination of official plugins. The table records verification scope, not a promise that every upstream release or account configuration works.

| Component | Baseline | What is verified |
|---|---|---|
| DSH | `0.1.5-rc.1` | Published contracts, WebUI and isolated Headless activation |
| Previous DSH line | `0.1.2-rc.1` | Current plugin: isolated Headless activation and restart; its synthetic Session logs migrate through the 0.1.5 public loader after copy repair |
| Historical DSH evidence | `0.1.1-rc.2` | Prior Sidebar/Builtin reports retain their own revisions; not rerun for this change |
| Node.js | `22.19` and `24` | Source CI and packed-artifact CI respectively; development requires `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0` |
| Node.js 20 | Public package imports only | Does not establish that the DSH Host runs on Node 20 |
| Mnemon Native CLI | `0.2.8` | Opt-in tests against a real CLI and disposable data; install the CLI separately |
| Third-party Providers | Adapter contracts and fixtures | Does not establish live cloud-account conformance or upstream availability |

See [DSH 0.1.5 verification](../../pr-assets/issue-223-dsh-015/README.md), [Host compatibility evidence](../../pr-assets/dsh-rc1-compat/README.md), [upgrade evidence](../../pr-assets/main-rebase-20260904/README.md), and [current development checks](../development/README.md). A passing mechanism test is not an LLM quality benchmark. OS-specific and real-CLI checks may be skipped unless their environment is explicitly available.

The historical v0.5.2 capture found unusable settings layout at 390px; [that failure evidence](../../pr-assets/documentation-refresh/README.md) remains versioned. The [v0.5.4 Light capture](../../assets/webui-v0.5.4/README.md) covers bilingual desktop browsing plus Memory Space navigation, creation and version maintenance at 390 × 844. Long card names and some metrics truncate. It does not retest every Host settings surface or physical phones, so the earlier settings limitation is not declared resolved.

## Upgrade the default installation

1. Export a Mnemon Pack and protect any required Provider connection backup as described in [Operations](../guides/operations.md#backup-and-recovery).
2. Upgrade `dsh-mnemon` in each DSH profile that uses it. The Starter installs its exact plugin versions; do not update its child packages independently and assume the resulting mixture is tested.
3. Restart DSH after installing new package code. Check **Memory System → Status**, then read an existing Runtime entry, Document and active Memory Space.
4. Verify the selected storage scope before writing. Changing the scope selects a different authority; it does not migrate data.

v0.5 preserves the default v0.4 storage/configuration and Sidebar workflow. Optional `builtin` uses the same Source pages; the retained `buildin` spelling is normalized. Three memory enhancements are supplied disabled. There is no View tab or generic memory-plugin manager in this release.

Independent plugin authors use declared peer ranges and public exports. Old private controller imports are not a supported upgrade surface. Custom compositions must be verified separately from the Starter. See [Extensions](../development/extensions.md) and the [v0.5.0 release boundary](../releases/v0.5.0.md).
