# Web, Headless, Tools, Commands, and RPC

[简体中文](../../zh-CN/reference/interfaces.md) | **English** | [Documentation hub](../README.md)

This page is an integration reference. For daily use, start with the [Sidebar and conversation UI guide](../guides/ui-guide.md).

## Memory space naming and compatibility

The product term is **memory space** (Chinese: **记忆空间**). The Source exports `MemorySpace`, `MemorySpaceView`, `MemorySpaceCatalog`, and corresponding request and metadata types. Previously published `MemoryBody*` types remain deprecated aliases with the same shapes.

Existing v0.5.x identifiers such as `mnemon_memory_bodies`, `mnemon_memory_body_create`, `body-directory`, and `memoryBodyId` / `memoryBodyIds` still refer to memory spaces. They remain stable for installed tools, Source pages, Provider adapters, and persisted Document/Pack lineage. The `.dsh-memory-bodies.json` filename and its `bodies` field are also retained. Renaming the product does not rename user-created spaces, change their IDs, move databases, or alter access grants.

## User-facing entry points

| Entry | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| Sidebar | Yes | Dedicated Memory System workbench with Status, Runtime, Documents, and Memory Spaces |
| Builtin | No | Optional conversation tab for the same workbench, automatically scoped to its session |
| Turn memory | Yes | Memory-tool summary for a completed turn, with exact page links |
| Save to memory | Yes | Action beside finalized assistant replies; confirmation invokes supervised writing |
| `/mnemon` | — | Conversation command entry |
| Model tools | — | Structured Root Agent read/write entry |

`displayMode` selects Sidebar (default) or Builtin; `tabEnabled` controls the selected entry's visibility. Builtin does not show the Sidebar scope controls. The two conversation shortcuts can be disabled independently through `mnemon-ui` settings.

## Profile surfaces

| Capability | Web | Headless |
|---|---:|---:|
| Runtime context and lifecycle guidance | Yes | Yes |
| Model tools and independent task Agents | Yes | Yes |
| Agent-cwd routing for `workspace` scope | Yes | Yes |
| Sidebar / conversation actions | Yes | No |
| Host-to-client RPC | Yes | No |
| Delayed score-based review after Agent idle | While the Host remains alive | Cancelled when the one-shot process exits |

Headless receives the full model-tool surface. Its task argument is submitted as an ordinary user message, so it does not provide an interactive slash-command dispatcher. Explicit and model-guided writes that finish before the Agent becomes idle are durable.

Model tools, lifecycle hooks, and system scheduling use an `automatic` trigger. User-initiated data-plane operations over Web/RPC use `manual`. Setting a Source to `manual` therefore preserves direct management while denying model tools and automatic projection. `memory-system` and `status` are control-plane observations and remain readable even when a Source is disabled.

## Model tools

### Read-only tools

| Tool | Purpose | Root Agent path |
|---|---|---|
| `mnemon_status` | Aggregated CLI, configuration, storage, and directory status | Direct service |
| `mnemon_memory_bodies` | Read catalog, provider capabilities, health, and available statistics | Direct service |
| `mnemon_recall` | Recall from active providers with heterogeneous rank fusion | Direct Host service under pinned Source authority |
| `mnemon_related` | Traverse only when `capabilities.related=true` | Direct Host service under pinned Source authority; Root defaults to two hops |
| `mnemon_document_search` | Deterministically search managed Documents | Documents control layer |

“Read only” means managed bodies and durable semantics do not change. `mnemon_document_search` still updates `lastAccessedAt` for LRU ordering, so feature read-only is not disk read-only.

### Tools available with `writeEnabled=true`

| Tool | Purpose | Root Agent path |
|---|---|---|
| `mnemon_runtime_memory` | `add` / `replace` / `remove` hot memory | Deterministic control; add overflow may start a worker |
| `mnemon_document_manage` | Create, update, or archive a Document | Create/update deterministic; archive uses a worker |
| `mnemon_document_create` | Create a separate Document without updating or archiving existing ones | Deterministic Source `create` Action; available to idle review |
| `mnemon_remember` | Retain one insight under Provider semantics; distinguish acceptance from durable completion | `spawn` write worker |
| `mnemon_link` | Create a typed relationship where the provider supports it | `spawn` write worker |
| `mnemon_forget` | Delete an exact ID where the provider supports it | `spawn` write worker for explicit operations only; excluded from autonomous distillation |
| `mnemon_memory_body_create` | Let an Agent create a Mnemon Native space; third-party connections remain user-managed in WebUI | `spawn` write worker |
| `mnemon_memory_body_update` | Update name, description, or active state | `spawn` write worker |
| `mnemon_memory_body_merge` | Non-destructively merge Mnemon Native spaces | `spawn` write worker |

When a worker invokes the same tool name, it reaches the service directly and is not delegated recursively.

Autonomous write workers — distillation and supervised writeback runs — decide content on their own, so the host excludes `mnemon_forget` from their hard tool allowlist: a duplicate or conflict is resolved by skipping or storing a corrected entry, never by deleting the existing one. Operations whose request names an exact target supplied by the user or a user-facing flow (`/mnemon forget`, `mnemon_link`, and Memory Space management) keep the full write toolset.

Idle review can search Documents and call `mnemon_document_create`, but cannot call `mnemon_document_manage` or `mnemon_view_action`. It skips covered candidates or creates one separate document referencing existing document ids. The Source's `create` Action accepts `title`, `content`, optional `description`, `sourcePaths`, and `sessionIds`; it rejects `action`, `id`, and other unknown fields. Capacity exhaustion rejects creation without archiving an existing document. This protection applies to existing user- and Agent-created documents. Explicit editing continues through the existing management paths.

`mnemon_runtime_memory` accepts an optional `branches` array (git branch names) for `target=memory` writes. Branch-scoped entries are projected into the per-turn Runtime snapshot only when the session's workspace is checked out on a listed branch; untagged entries are always projected. On `replace`, providing `branches` changes the scope, an empty array clears it, and omitting it keeps the current scope. The parameter is rejected for `target=user`.

## Tool admission

- **Runtime**: explicit preferences, stable project conventions, environment facts, and high-frequency lessons.
- **Documents**: designs, investigations, procedures, postmortems, or handoffs with complete structure and rationale.
- **Memory Spaces**: stable facts, decisions, and insights that must survive across tasks or benefit from graph relationships.
- **Skip**: questions, guesses, temporary progress, completion logs, raw output, secrets, and ordinary repository facts that are easy to rediscover.

`mnemon_forget` is a destructive semantic action. Use it only on explicit request or after confirming that content is wrong or obsolete. The host enforces this for autonomous workers by excluding the tool from their allowlist; the main agent can still call it when the user explicitly asks.

## `/mnemon` commands

```text
/mnemon
/mnemon status
/mnemon recall <query>
/mnemon related <full memory ID>
/mnemon remember <content>
/mnemon forget <exact ID>
```

- Empty `/mnemon` equals `status`.
- `status` is deterministic and starts no model.
- `recall` and `related` read through the live Agent's scoped Source route without spawning a worker. `remember` and `forget` use that Agent as the write worker's parent.
- Command recall returns at most 10 results.
- `forget` requires one exact ID without spaces.
- `forget` reports deletion only for a `forgotten` receipt; skipped, failed, or unconfirmed results are reported as errors with the worker summary.

## In-conversation contracts

| DSH slot | Registration | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `conversation.chat.turnTail` | chain | `turn-activity` summarizes `mnemon_*` calls from completed turns; open turns and turns without activity render nothing |
| `conversation.chat.assistant-actions` | list, `id=mnemon-save` | `assistant-message` reads finalized text; `supervise` runs only after confirmation |

Both are additive and replace no official DSH rendering. The assistant-message candidate is editable and long replies are bounded by the UI preview limit. Confirmation starts an independent task Agent, and persistence is complete only after its settled receipt.

## Workspace routing

Web workbench requests carry `sessionId` and an optional `workspaceId`. The Host accepts only IDs registered in `workspaceRegistry`:

- deterministic reads and manual maintenance may route to the inspected root selected by `workspaceId`;
- Agents, tools, commands, and lifecycle hooks still route by the Agent cwd associated with `sessionId`;
- `status.workspaceContext` returns selected / effective roots and `aligned`;
- independent task Agents started from the workbench use the inspected workspace; they do not require the main conversation to match. Conversation tools continue to use their own session cwd and pinned View, not the workbench inspection scope.

Profiles without a Web workspace registry, including Headless, have no arbitrary inspection target. Agent execution still routes `workspace` scope directly from the session cwd.

## RPC channels

RPC is an internal Host-to-client bridge, not a stable external HTTP API.

### Read channel

```text
channel:   /dsh-mnemon-read
rc.2 rollback authority: trusted-host
0.1.2 authentication: DSH browser session
```

| Endpoint | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `status` | Aggregated service, version, lifecycle, Documents, workspace/storage context, and current Memory System descriptor |
| `memory-system` | Serving/candidate evaluation, sanitized Source instance descriptors and current participation configuration |
| `versions` | Check installed/latest Mnemon and dsh-mnemon versions and installation sources |
| `runtime-memory` | Runtime snapshot |
| `documents` / `document` / `document-search` | Directory, body, and deterministic search |
| `graph` / `bodies` / `body-directory` | Active multi-space graph projection, provider-capability catalog, and fast directory projection |
| `body-reconnect` | Invalidate transient health state and refresh one Memory Space without changing persistent data |
| `provider-services` | Redacted Provider service catalog; configured-secret names may be present, secret values never are |
| `list` / `entities` | Durable content list and entity aggregation |
| `search` / `agent-search` / `related` | Direct retrieval, evidence answer, and relation traversal |
| `turn-activities` / `turn-activity` | Session-wide or single-turn memory-tool activity |
| `assistant-message` | Finalized assistant text by messageId |

### Write channel

Memory Space activation has a narrower request schema on its own control channel:

```text
channel:   /dsh-mnemon-activation
rc.2 rollback authority: trusted-host
0.1.2 authentication: DSH browser session
endpoint:  body
```

`body` accepts only `memoryBodyId`, a Boolean `active`, and the normal session/workspace routing fields. It controls participation in DSH reads and routing without accepting metadata, Provider connection, credential, deletion, or durable-memory mutations. Read-only mode rejects it at the Host boundary.

All broader mutations remain on the write channel:

```text
channel:   /dsh-mnemon-write
rc.2 rollback authority: loopback (`trusted-host` when `remoteAccess=trusted-host`)
0.1.2 authentication: DSH browser session
```

| Endpoint | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `runtime-memory` | Hot-memory mutation |
| `supervise` | Process a candidate under an independent task Agent and return a settled receipt |
| `document` | create / update / archive |
| `remember` / `link` / `forget` | Durable semantic write, relation, and soft deletion |
| `body-create` / `body-update` / `body-delete` | Create/connect, edit, or confirm Native deletion / remote disconnection |
| `body-reconnect` | Legacy compatibility route for clients released before reconnect moved to the read channel |
| `provider-service-update` | Update one Provider service; credentials remain on the Host and the response is redacted |
| `version-update` | Update a named component with Host-fixed commands and arguments |

`provider-services` returns a redacted catalog through the read channel. The settings editor knows which credential fields are configured; it can replace or explicitly clear them without reading saved values back.

With `writeEnabled=false`, both activation control and the write channel remain registered but mutations are rejected at the Host boundary. The browser also disables mutation controls from the Host's settings snapshot before transport.

### Backup channel

```text
channel:   /dsh-mnemon-pack
rc.2 rollback authority: loopback (`trusted-host` when `remoteAccess=trusted-host`)
0.1.2 authentication: DSH browser session
```

| Endpoint | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `target` | Effective root and scope |
| `export` | Export a complete ZIP with manifest and SHA-256 checksums |
| `inspect` | Parse and verify an import ZIP, returning component and occupancy preview |
| `import` | Safely merge into the effective root; rejected in read-only mode |

Backups contain private memory, so callers must treat the authenticated DSH browser session as a full Host authority and protect exported archives separately.

### Settings channel

```text
channel:   /dsh-mnemon-settings
rc.2 rollback authority: loopback (`trusted-host` when `remoteAccess=trusted-host`)
0.1.2 authentication: DSH browser session
namespaces: mnemon, mnemon-ui
endpoints: get, mutate
```

Mutations use settings revisions to prevent overwriting concurrent edits. `mnemon` owns Host/storage settings; `mnemon-ui` owns `turnBar` and `saveAction`. The `dsh-mnemon` page under Plugins (`plugins.bundle.config`) reads and writes through this channel on loopback and remote pages alike. On loopback pages it also follows DSH's `ctx.configForms` revision of the `mnemon` entry and re-reads the channel when another page or a profile reload changes it.

Mnemon uses one registration call shape for both transport generations: it always supplies the rc.2 authority object, which DSH 0.1.2 ignores as an extra JavaScript argument. Thus stable DSH 0.1.2-rc.1 and its alpha.5 predecessor authenticate the complete Host API with one browser session, while the rc.2 rollback retains method-specific trust tiers. No runtime version or function-arity branch is used.

## npm exports and extension service

Core publishes `ctx.mnemonMemory: MnemonMemoryService`; the actual service exposes only `installContributions`. Source/Strategy authors use `inject = ['mnemonMemory']` and `installMemory`, without receiving an engine, controller or registry. Public subpaths are defined by each package's `package.json#exports`; Sources may provide their own `./contracts` and optional `./client`.

| Entry | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `dsh-mnemon` | DSH Host and default Starter |
| `dsh-mnemon/core` | Source-neutral `ctx.mnemonMemory` service, without Host/UI |
| `dsh-mnemon/contracts` | JSON-safe manifests, facts, ViewSpec, View, Evidence and Receipt |
| `dsh-mnemon/extension-sdk` | Source/Strategy definitions, lifecycle installation and validators |
| `dsh-mnemon/testing` | Real Cordis composition fixture and built Client artifact loader |
| `dsh-mnemon/client` | DSH workspace and Source-page SDK |
| `dsh-mnemon-source-memory-spaces/provider-sdk` | Memory Spaces' own Provider child-module contract |
| `dsh-mnemon-source-memory-spaces/testing` | Provider driver fixture |

Generic model tools `mnemon_view_route` and `mnemon_view_action` execute only routes/offers present in the current View. Existing named tools preserve the default workflow. Browser management uses `source-management-catalog`, `source-management-read`, `source-management-mutate` and optional `source-assistance`; instance identity, confirmation, revision and current authority are checked by the Host/Source. Internal RPC names are not the plugin SDK: use the scoped page client. See [Plugin development](../development/extensions.md).

## Internationalization

The main Sidebar workbench, the configuration page under Plugins, and conversation entries support Chinese and English and follow DSH locale live. Brand names, tool names, and configuration keys are not translated. `/mnemon` commands, model-tool cards, some Host errors, and compatibility metadata remain partially untranslated.
