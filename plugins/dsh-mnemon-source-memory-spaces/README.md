# dsh-mnemon-source-memory-spaces

Memory Spaces owns its Provider contracts and private child-Fiber host. Provider authors depend on `dsh-mnemon-source-memory-spaces/provider-sdk`, never on the main repository's controllers or global registry.

The Source owns its storage registry, scoped native command transport, recall policy, routing, receipts and management operations. It imports **no Provider implementation** and defines no extra Context service. Each mount defaults to a separate data directory; set `dataDir` explicitly to select an existing authority.

A **memory space** (中文：**记忆空间**) is one named Provider-backed scope containing individual memories. Use the canonical `MemorySpace`, `MemorySpaceView`, `MemorySpaceCatalog`, and `CreateMemorySpaceRequest` types from `./contracts`; `MemoryBody*` exports remain deprecated aliases for existing consumers. The Provider SDK exposes `MemorySpace` and `ProviderSpaceStatus` while retaining its old type aliases. Provider factories can use `context.memorySpaces ?? context.memoryBodies` to support both new and existing Source hosts. Published wire fields, registry filenames, and stored user names remain unchanged.

Install the chosen Provider packages and configure them explicitly on the Source entry:

```yaml
name: dsh-mnemon-source-memory-spaces
config:
  dataDir: /absolute/path/to/memory
  providers:
    - use: dsh-mnemon-provider-holographic
      instanceId: local-facts
```

The host must already provide `ctx.mnemonMemory`; a Strategy decides how this Source enters the LLM View. For programmatic composition, import `installMemorySpaces` and pass explicit typed child modules. It returns `Promise<void>`; no private Host or Snapshot escapes. Omitting the child list is an error, not automatic dependency discovery. The default `dsh-mnemon` bundle supplies the existing nine Providers and existing storage settings separately.

Host archive workflows can read `body-directory` with `{ writeScope: { viewId, grant } }`, using `MemorySpaceWriteScopeRequest` from `./contracts`. The optional catalog `writeScope` returns the View id, exact Source instance and authorized `memoryBodyIds`; it shares `remember` authority for known namespaces and spaces created by that View. Empty scopes remain empty. The Host must bind the input to its initiating View and Source, validate the response identity, and recheck live capabilities before writing. Older Sources that omit the response require a conservative pinned-namespace fallback; read grants must never be interpreted as unlimited authority.

Run `pnpm install && pnpm verify` in this directory. Its own tests mount real Cordis Fibers and exercise Source isolation, scoped management, View actions/routes, persistence and failed-child cleanup. Provider authors use `mountMemorySpaceProvider(module, { instanceId, config })` from the public `/testing` entry to test actual child registration and obtain frozen metadata plus `createAdapter`/`dispose`. `createMemorySpaceProviderFixture` supplies scoped authority and validated connection data for driver tests. Dispose the mounted fixture to release its adapters and Fiber. Neither fixture exposes the private Host, Registry or Snapshot; test the full Source separately for View integration.

## Configuration ownership

The public package entry exports `resolveEmbedding`, `resolvePersistenceStrategy`, and `resolveRecallQuality`. They validate and normalize this Source's settings without I/O or mounting a Fiber. The Starter uses the same rules and recall defaults; it still owns legacy setting keys, storage scope, and its Host timeout policy. Independent Source configuration retains its own instance defaults and timeout limits.

## Source-owned Client

The optional `./client` entry owns the Source's pages and `presentation/` resources. It uses `dsh-mnemon/client` for the shared frame and scoped management, without receiving raw RPC transport, credentials, a Host Context or an LLM grant. DSH mounts the same pages in the default Starter; cross-Source Agent workflows remain optional Host assistance.

`pnpm verify` checks Host behavior, real Source-backed page interactions, and Host/browser artifacts. Client tests consume the installed Core's public testing entry.

In this fork, a Host generation marked `accountIsolated` makes its account storage configuration authoritative over Source entry settings. Memory Spaces additionally requires the Native provider exclusively. See [account deployment](https://github.com/sdwhwzp/dsh-mnemon/blob/dev/docs/en/guides/accounts.md).
