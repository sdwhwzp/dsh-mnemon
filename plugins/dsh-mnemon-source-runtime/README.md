# dsh-mnemon-source-runtime

Owns USER / MEMORY records, exact revisions, branch filtering, bounded projection and local capacity maintenance.

## Use

The `dsh-mnemon` Starter installs and mounts this Source by default. The package alone does not activate an instance or select a Strategy.

For a custom Profile, mount an explicit Entry after the Host's `ctx.mnemonMemory` service is available:

```yaml
- id: personal-runtime
  name: dsh-mnemon-source-runtime
  config:
    dataDir: /absolute/path/to/personal-memory
```

Choose an existing data authority deliberately. Without `dataDir`, each stable Source instance uses an isolated directory under `~/.mnemon/sources/`; the default Starter supplies the existing product paths. Replacing the default Source or adding a second instance requires an explicit selection Strategy, not a second implicit default role.

Disabling participation does not delete stored entries. Source data remains separate from the current turn's projection and access grants.

Model projections annotate each entry with its recorded importance and elapsed whole-day ages, for example `[importance=critical; created=14d; updated=2d]`, followed by the exact content. Future timestamps show `future`; unparseable ones show `unknown`. Ages are captured once per projection and remain fixed for that turn. Annotations count toward the Strategy's projection budget, but do not change stored JSON/Markdown, content matching or storage capacity. For replacement/removal, use only the entry content. Current instructions retain priority.

## Source-owned UI and tests

The optional `./client` entry is an ordinary DSH Client plugin. This package owns its pages and `presentation/` resources and uses `dsh-mnemon/client` for the shared frame and scoped management client. It never receives a Host Context, credentials or another Source's controller.

From a source checkout, install the declared dependencies and run `pnpm verify` to check Host behavior, Source-backed page interactions and Host/browser artifacts. Unreleased SDK work consumes a packed `dsh-mnemon` peer, not repository aliases or copied root tests.

In this fork, a Host generation marked `accountIsolated` makes its account storage configuration authoritative over Source entry settings. Memory Spaces additionally requires the Native provider exclusively. See [account deployment](https://github.com/sdwhwzp/dsh-mnemon/blob/dev/docs/en/guides/accounts.md).
