# dsh-mnemon-provider-openviking

An adapter for an existing OpenViking HTTP service and its filesystem-shaped memory resources.

Requires a reachable OpenViking endpoint supporting `POST /api/v1/content/write` with `mode: "create"`, `wait: true`, and tags. Agent-authored memories use unique Markdown files; the adapter verifies completed indexing and exact full-content readback before returning `stored` with a reversible `id`. It does not create extraction sessions.

The supported scope is `viking://user/<user>/memories`. Existing `viking://user/memories` settings resolve through the configured user or authenticated `/api/v1/system/status` identity, without rewriting the local registry. A failed response, timeout, or mismatched readback produces an error instead of a committed receipt. The error includes the requested URI because remote content may remain; inspect it before retrying. Existing memories remain readable, and downgrading does not remove files written by this adapter.

## Use

The default `dsh-mnemon` Starter already installs this package. Enable and configure the service in **Settings → Memory System**, then inspect its synchronized Memory Spaces.

For a user API key without Admin API access, including managed OpenViking Service endpoints, fill `endpoint`, `apiKey`, `account`, and **User key owner (skip admin)** (`discoveryUser`) with the supplied account/user identifiers. The adapter validates `viking://user/<discoveryUser>/memories` through the read-only `/api/v1/fs/ls` data API and synchronizes that one space. It sends no account/user identity headers in this mode: the key determines the authenticated tenant, and `account` identifies the local projection rather than overriding that identity. Use an existing accessible memory root; an absent root, rejected key, invalid response, or denied owner fails the save and preserves previous settings. Health-only success is insufficient. This path does not verify write permission or certify a particular cloud deployment; exact writes still require the content API above.

Leave `discoveryUser` empty for the existing admin discovery flow. There is no automatic fallback after an admin error. Nonempty `discoveryUser` requires a safe user ID, an explicit account, and an API key; manually configured memory owners must match it. The new setting uses the existing service registry format. Before downgrading to an adapter without this field, clear it using the current version and use admin-capable configuration, or disable the service and restore an older compatible configuration. Reconnection and downgrade never delete remote memories.

For a custom composition, install this package alongside `dsh-mnemon-source-memory-spaces` and include it in that Source's `config.providers`:

```yaml
providers:
  - use: dsh-mnemon-provider-openviking
    instanceId: openviking
```

This is a **Memory Spaces child module**, not a top-level Source or a complete Strategy. It registers through `dsh-mnemon-source-memory-spaces/provider-sdk`; each parent Source owns its child Fibers, connection settings and lifetime. Credentials stay on the Host.

## Develop independently

From a source checkout with the declared dependencies installed, run `pnpm verify`. Tests, build and public exports belong to this package, without importing another package's controllers or repository configuration. Use the Source's public `/testing` fixtures for child registration and driver conformance; live service tests require a separately authorized environment.

To test a disposable local OpenViking service (never a personal store), run `MNEMON_OPENVIKING_TEST_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:1933 pnpm exec vitest run tests/integration.spec.ts`. Supply `MNEMON_OPENVIKING_TEST_API_KEY` when the service requires authentication. It creates one synthetic canary in the default user's namespace, reads/searches/browses it, and deletes its exact URI. Ordinary verification skips this optional integration test. Admin discovery requires a key allowed to enumerate users; ROOT keys cannot access tenant data in `api_key` mode. The user-key regression uses deterministic responses, not a live cloud account.
